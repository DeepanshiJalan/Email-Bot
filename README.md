# Email-Bot
The Email Bot is a python project to enable voice based email system for blind people. 
Email is one of the most important medium of communication in the present world for sharing professional and time sensitive information. Though it is of much importance, the visually impaired persons can make no use of it. It is estimated that globally around 2.2 million people are visually impaired. Though there have been many advancements in the field, the existing systems cannot help the visually impaired persons use the email systems much effectively. Thus, this paper aims to provide a solution- Email Bot, which is an interactive system for visually impaired persons to use the email system with just voice commands. It is built using speech recognition and is useful not only for the blind persons but also to people who have trouble in reading and writing.
